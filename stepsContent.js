      title: "John Snow – The Early Years",
      text: "John Snow was born in 1813 in York, England, and went on to study medicine in Newcastle. His curiosity for science and his drive to challenge prevailing medical views led him to become a pioneer in anesthesia. However, his most groundbreaking work would come in the field of epidemiology, specifically during the 1854 cholera outbreak in London."

    {
      step: 2,
      title: "The Cholera Outbreak of 1854",
      text: "John Snow's investigation led him to a public water pump on Broad Street, which became the epicenter of his theory. Located at the heart of Soho, this pump drew hundreds of residents daily for water. Snow mapped the cholera deaths around the pump and found a stark pattern emerging, reinforcing his hypothesis that the water was the source of the disease."

      step: 3,
      title: "Broad Street Pump – Ground Zero",
      text: "John Snow's investigation led him to a public water pump on Broad Street, which became the epicenter of his theory. Located at the heart of Soho, this pump drew hundreds of residents daily for water. Snow mapped the cholera deaths around the pump and found a stark pattern emerging, reinforcing his hypothesis that the water was the source of the disease."
    },
    {
      step: 4,
      title: "The First Clue – A Cluster of Deaths",
      text: "On September 1, 1854, John Snow began mapping cholera deaths, noting a cluster of fatalities near the Broad Street pump. In just a few days, 10 people living within 100 yards of the pump had died. The close proximity of these deaths to the pump strengthened his belief that contaminated water, not air, was spreading cholera."
    },
    {
      step: 5,
      title: "Deaths on Cambridge Street",
      text: "Snow extended his investigation to nearby streets like Cambridge Street, where more deaths were recorded. On this street alone, seven individuals succumbed to cholera. Once again, the proximity to the Broad Street pump was undeniable, adding more weight to his waterborne theory."
    },
    {
      step: 6,
      title: "Carnaby Street – A Close Connection",
      text: "As Snow surveyed the area, he mapped more deaths along Carnaby Street. The death toll continued to rise, with six victims in a small radius. Snow's map now had several clusters, each pointing back to a common source: the Broad Street pump."
    },
    {
      step: 7,
      title: "Pump at Golden Square – A Different Outcome",
      text: "Snow also examined other pumps in the area, including the one at Golden Square. While deaths were recorded around this pump, they were significantly fewer. Snow noted that the water from this pump seemed less contaminated than the Broad Street pump, leading him to focus even more on the latter as the main source."
    },
    {
      step: 8,
      title: "The Workhouse Exception",
      text: "Curiously, while the neighborhood suffered, a nearby workhouse had very few cases of cholera. Snow later discovered that the workhouse had its own private water supply, completely separate from the Broad Street pump. This anomaly became a crucial piece of evidence for Snow’s theory, showing that people who avoided the pump’s water were less affected."
    },
    {
      step: 9,
      title: "John Snow's Bold Move",
      text: "After gathering extensive evidence, Snow took the bold step of presenting his findings to local authorities. He argued that the Broad Street pump was the source of the cholera outbreak and urged them to remove the pump handle to prevent further contamination. Though the 'miasma' theory was still widely accepted, officials agreed to his request."
    },
    {
      step: 10,
      title: "The Pump Handle is Removed",
      text: "On September 8, 1854, the Broad Street pump handle was removed, and soon after, the cholera outbreak slowed dramatically. While it would take years for the medical community to fully accept Snow’s waterborne theory, this decisive action marked a turning point in public health policy. John Snow's map, meticulously documenting the deaths around the pumps, became one of the earliest examples of epidemiological investigation."
    },
    {
      step: 11,
      title: "Revisiting the Broad Street Pump – An Aftermath",
      text: "After the epidemic subsided, Snow revisited his research on the Broad Street pump. He discovered that a cesspool near the pump had been leaking sewage into the water supply. This confirmed his theory and provided a clear explanation of how cholera had spread through contaminated drinking water."
    },
    {
      step: 12,
      title: "John Snow’s Legacy",
      text: "Though John Snow passed away in 1858, his work left an indelible mark on the field of public health. His cholera map remains a powerful visual tool in epidemiology, influencing generations of researchers and urban planners. The pump at Broad Street became a symbol of the triumph of scientific investigation over popular misconception."
    },
    {
      step: 13,
      title: "The Pump Today – A Memorial to Science",
      text: "Today, a replica of the Broad Street pump stands in Soho, London, just a few steps away from its original location. It serves as a reminder of John Snow’s pioneering work and the lives saved by his groundbreaking discovery. The map he created, linking death locations to pump coordinates, continues to inspire how we understand and manage disease outbreaks."
