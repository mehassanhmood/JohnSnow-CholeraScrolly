      title: "John Snow – The Early Years",
      text: "John Snow was born in 1813 in York, England, and went on to study medicine in Newcastle. His curiosity for science and his drive to challenge prevailing medical views led him to become a pioneer in anesthesia. However, his most groundbreaking work would come in the field of epidemiology, specifically during the 1854 cholera outbreak in London."

      step: 2,
      title: "The Cholera Outbreak of 1854 and Soho Dsitrict",
      text: "In the summer of 1854, a deadly cholera outbreak swept through the Soho district of London. Hundreds fell ill, many died, and the source of the epidemic remained a mystery. But one man—Dr. John Snow—was determined to find the truth. Armed with nothing but his sharp mind and a deep belief in data, Snow embarked on a journey to understand the outbreak."

    {
      step: 3,
      title: "Broad Street Pump – Ground Zero",
      text: "John Snow's investigation led him to a public water pump on Broad Street, which became the epicenter of his theory. Located at the heart of Soho, this pump drew hundreds of residents daily for water. Snow mapped the cholera deaths around the pump and found a stark pattern emerging, reinforcing his hypothesis that the water was the source of the disease."

      step: 4,
      title: "Crown Chapel",
      text: "A short walk away, at Crown Chapel (51.513876, -0.139586), another pump serves the community. Nearby deaths, while fewer, contribute to Snow’s growing dataset. With every step, he maps not just the disease but the habits of the people—their daily routines, where they live, where they drink water. More deaths, more data points, and yet the evidence keeps pointing back to Broad Street."
    },
    {
      step: 5,
      title: "Great Marlborough Street",
      text: "On Great Marlborough Street (51.514906, -0.139671), Snow’s findings begin to sharpen. There have been deaths here too, though fewer than around Broad Street. The pump on this street serves fewer people, but Snow’s analysis is relentless. He knows that every pump tells part of the story, and each one must be examined if he is to prove his theory."
    },
    {
      step: 6,
      title: "Dean Street",
      text: "Moving toward Dean Street (51.512354, -0.13163), Snow observes more cases of cholera. As with the other pumps, the number of deaths helps Snow build his theory that the water supply, not the air, is spreading the disease. He tracks every movement with the precision of a surgeon. Snow’s data-driven approach is unheard of at the time—he’s turning the investigation into a numbers game."
    },
    {
      step: 7,
      title: "Pump at Golden Square – A Different Outcome",
      text: "Moving toward Dean Street (51.512354, -0.13163), Snow observes more cases of cholera. As with the other pumps, the number of deaths helps Snow build his theory that the water supply, not the air, is spreading the disease. He tracks every movement with the precision of a surgeon. Snow’s data-driven approach is unheard of at the time—he’s turning the investigation into a numbers game."
    },
    {
      step: 8,
      title: "Bridle Street",
      text: "In the narrow lanes near Bridle Street (51.511542, -0.135919), Snow continues to document deaths. Each pump in Soho adds a new layer to his understanding. The patterns are becoming clearer. More deaths around some pumps, fewer around others—it’s the puzzle Snow is solving one pump at a time."
    },
    {
      step: 9,
      title: "Coventry Street",
      text: "As Snow approaches Coventry Street (51.510019, -0.133962), he sees that the farther away he gets from Broad Street, the fewer deaths he records. His data maps are beginning to show a sharp drop in cases the farther one moves from the epicenter of the outbreak. This is no coincidence. Snow is close to proving his theory."
    },
    {
      step: 10,
      title: "Warwick Street",
      text: "Finally, Snow reaches Warwick Street (51.511295, -0.138199). His data now spans the entire neighborhood. Deaths clustered around Broad Street, tapering off near other pumps. His data doesn’t just show the spread of the disease—it shows its source. The Broad Street pump is at the heart of the outbreak."
    },
    {
      step: 11,
      title: "The Pump Today – A Memorial to Science",
      text: "Snow’s method was simple but brilliant. By plotting the location of each death and cross-referencing them with the water sources, he was able to connect the dots. The Broad Street pump was the common denominator. In a bold move, Snow convinced the authorities to remove the pump handle, cutting off access to the contaminated water. And just like that, the cholera outbreak began to fade. John Snow’s legacy isn’t just about cholera—it’s about data. His maps and his data-driven approach changed the way we think about disease, laying the groundwork for modern epidemiology."
